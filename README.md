=========

I wanted to do this as a test project using
[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org). I used Ryan Bates'
RailsCast Episodes 323 and 325 as a starting point, but they're
outdated so it was a little more involved than just copy + paste.

I also added the functionality to clear the winners fields, as well as
delete entries on the list.

Strictly a reference project for Backbone.js
